    steps:
      # Step 1: Checkout your code
      - name: Checkout repository
        uses: actions/checkout@v4

      # Step 2: Setup Flutter (using a slightly older, known-stable version)
      - name: Setup Flutter
        uses: subosito/flutter-action@v2
        with:
          channel: 'stable'
          # Switched to a known stable version that is less likely to cause CI resolution issues
          flutter-version: 'latest'
          cache: true

      # Step 3: Verify the version installed
      - name: Verify Flutter Version
        run: flutter --version

      # Step 4: Get dependencies
      - name: Install dependencies
        run: flutter pub get

      # Step 5: Run code generation for Hive adapters
      - name: Run Build Runner (Code Generation)
        run: flutter packages pub run build_runner build --delete-conflicting-outputs

      # Step 6: Analyze code for linting and style errors
      - name: Analyze code
        run: flutter analyze

      # Step 7: Run tests
      - name: Run tests
        # Use --no-pub to speed up test execution since pub get ran earlier
        run: flutter test --no-pub
